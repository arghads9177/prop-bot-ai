# PropBot AI - Proposal Generation Tool

## Framework & Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** LangChain
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB (for retrieving stored proposal templates)
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT models
- **Document Processing:** Python-docx, ReportLab
- **Data Processing:** Pandas

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: UI Development
- Implement a **sidebar menu** with two options: Freelancing Proposal (default) and Business Proposal.
- Display input fields:
  - **Freelancing Proposal:** "About You" and "Job Requirements"
  - **Business Proposal:** "About Your Business" and "Job Requirements"
- Add a button to generate proposals in **DOCX** and **PDF** formats.

### Phase 2: Proposal Generation Pipeline
- Design a **Prompting Strategy** for proposal generation:
  - If freelancer/business details are missing, model should prompt the user to provide them.
  - If job requirements are unclear, model should request clarification.
- Load **predefined proposal templates** from a template folder.
- Utilize **LangChain’s LLM integration** to generate proposals dynamically.

### Phase 3: Document Generation
- Convert LLM-generated proposals into:
  - **DOCX format** using `python-docx`
  - **PDF format** using `ReportLab`

### Phase 4: Enhancements & Optimization
- Improve response validation for missing information.
- Implement caching for faster proposal retrieval.
- Fine-tune prompt engineering for better-quality proposals.

This structured approach ensures an AI-powered proposal generation tool tailored for freelancers and business owners. 🚀
