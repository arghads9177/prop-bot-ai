3. DETAILED SCOPE OF WORK:
3.1 Introduction:
Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL), a leading steel manufacturer under SAIL, is expanding its production capacity from 5 million
tons (MT) to 8 MT. To support this growth, an efficient rail logistics system is crucial, handling on an average over 350
raw material rakes and 150 finished product rakes per month, covering more than 95% of BSL's logistics operations.
Currently, Traffic dept, BSL manages around 300 km of rail tracks, owns and operates around 57 locomotives, and
utilizes wagons from its own fleet, private vendors, and Indian Railways. Effective coordination is required between
external stakeholders (mines, Indian Railways, FOIS, CRIS, SAP) and internal units (RMHP, BF, SMS, CCS, loading units).
At present, these transactions are managed via the Traffic Info System (TRIS). The objective of this project is to upgrade
TRIS into a unified digital rail logistics solution, ensuring a seamless, technology-driven approach to logistics
management.
Also, as part of SAIL digital transformation and modernization strategy, this project aligns with the company's vision to
implement smart, automated solutions that enhances efficiency, tracking, transparency, and operational control. The
project aims to revolutionize its logistics framework, improved turnaround time, reduced demurrage, reducing manual
intervention, seamless integration with external business and enabling proactive decision-making.
